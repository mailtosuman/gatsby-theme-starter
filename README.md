# Gatsby Theme starter kit Example

This repo is an example and potential starting point for theme creators.

It includes:

- a bare-bones theme (located in `theme/`) that includes basic setup
- a demo site (located in `site/`) that installs the theme
- a Yarn workspaces configuration so the theme and demo can be worked on simultaneously
